Hint 8:

Currently, the structure of the tree at this
state is as follows:
    #k
   /  \
  l    r
...where l != null, and #vsl is the list
of elements in the subtree pointed by l.
The recursive call to BSTFindMin(l) returns
list_member(#vsl, min, true) and
list_min(#vsl, min). What now remains
is to show how min relates to #k and
and the keys in the subtree pointed by r.

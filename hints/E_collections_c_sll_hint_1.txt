Hint 1:

There are primarily three components to the loop invariant:
- The lseg predicate, which describes the list of pointers that
  have already been traversed,
- (prev -b> val, node), which describes the current node the loop
  is at, and
- The sll predicate, which describes the list of pointers that have
  not yet been traversed.
Note that before we enter the loop, the sll predicate should describe
the entire list, but the sll predicate we have so far probably only
describes the last element of the list. One needs to 'concatenate'
the lseg and sll predicates in the current state to get the desired
sll predicate.

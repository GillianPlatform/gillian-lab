Hint 2:

List length iter hint 2:
We are modifying y to be the next part of the list.
In order to re-establish the loop invariant, we need to unpack list(y, #vs2)
to get the right predicate, and append it to listseg(x, y, #vs1).
However, we can't simply do it by folding and unfolding, so it is required
To use a lemma.
